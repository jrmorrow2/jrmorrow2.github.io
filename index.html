				<p>My name is James Morrow and here are some facts about me that has shaped my view of the world:</p>
				<ol class="list1">
					<li>I was told that I was learning disabled in Elementary School.</li>
					<li>I failed Math in highschool.</li> 
					<li>I never took the SAT.</li> 
					<li>I worked at a Jamba Juice for six months after I finished my undergrad.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>If you are like me, you may have been mislead by others to think you can't be clever, you can't be smart, you can't be successful or whatever else small-minded people want you to believe about yourself.</p>
				<p>I want to tell you that they are wrong, but you may already know that.</p>
